## **When Would You Need a Wrapped Token (wAGC)?**

### **1. Overview**

A wrapped token (wAGC) is a version of your native AGC token designed to operate on other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana. This allows AGC to be used in ecosystems where it is not natively supported. The wrapped token is typically backed 1:1 by the original AGC token, which is locked in a smart contract.

### **2. Scenarios for Using a Wrapped Token (wAGC)**

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: To enable AGC to function on blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, which do not natively support AGC.
- **DeFi Integration**: To allow AGC to participate in DeFi protocols on other blockchains.
- **Liquidity Provision**: To provide liquidity for AGC on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across different blockchains.
- **Cross-Chain Transfers**: To facilitate the transfer of AGC across different blockchain networks.

### **3. Pros of Using a Wrapped Token (wAGC)**

1. **Interoperability**:
   - Allows AGC to be used on multiple blockchains, increasing its functionality and reach.
   - Enables participation in diverse blockchain ecosystems and applications.

2. **Liquidity and Market Access**:
   - Increases liquidity by allowing AGC to be traded on multiple platforms.
   - Opens up new trading pairs and markets for AGC.

3. **DeFi Participation**:
   - Enables AGC to be used in DeFi protocols like lending, borrowing, and yield farming on other blockchains.
   - Provides additional use cases for AGC, enhancing its value proposition.

4. **Risk Diversification**:
   - Allows users to spread assets across multiple blockchains, reducing exposure to risks associated with a single blockchain.

### **4. Cons of Using a Wrapped Token (wAGC)**

1. **Technical Complexity**:
   - Requires developing and maintaining smart contracts on multiple blockchains, increasing technical overhead.
   - Involves managing bridge infrastructure and oracle services, which can be complex and costly.

2. **Security Risks**:
   - Bridges and wrapped token contracts are potential targets for hacks and exploits, which can lead to loss of funds.
   - Increases the attack surface due to multiple smart contracts and bridge operations.

3. **Centralization Risks**:
   - Some wrapping mechanisms involve custodians holding the native tokens, introducing counterparty risk.
   - Trust in the bridge operators or custodians is required, which can undermine decentralization.

4. **Liquidity Fragmentation**:
   - Splits liquidity across different blockchains, potentially reducing liquidity on the native chain.
   - Can impact the overall trading efficiency and price stability of AGC.

5. **Cost Implications**:
   - Users may incur additional fees for wrapping and unwrapping tokens and for cross-chain transactions.
   - Operating and maintaining bridge infrastructure involves ongoing costs.
