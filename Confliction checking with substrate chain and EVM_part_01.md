# Conflic checking between Substrate and EVM Account


| Feature                      | Substrate Account                                 | EVM-Compatible Account                              | Potential Conflicts                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Underlying Technology**    | Customizable blockchain framework.                | Runs Ethereum smart contracts; uses Ethereum tools. | Different base technologies limit direct interoperability. |
| **Account Format**           | Uses public-private key pair, SS58 address format. | Hexadecimal address format derived from public key. | Incompatible address formats can complicate cross-platform interactions. |
| **Compatibility**            | Customizable, can integrate EVM if configured.    | Directly compatible with Ethereum and its dApps.    | Default configurations may not support cross-chain functionality without modifications. |
| **Functionality and Use**    | Highly customizable, supports governance, staking. | Focused on smart contracts and dApps.               | Substrate's broader functionality may not be fully utilizable in EVM without specific adjustments. |
| **Security and Network**     | Additional security features can be designed.     | Depends on Ethereum's security and features.        | Security assumptions and features may differ, requiring careful integration planning. |

| **Gas and Fee Mechanisms**   | Substrate uses flexible, customizable fee structures, different from the EVM's gas-based model.         | Confusion and incompatibility in transaction fees leading to potential execution issues. |
| **Consensus Mechanisms**     | Substrate supports various consensus mechanisms, which may not align with those used by EVM.            | Affects block validation and network security; requires alignment for proper functionality. |
| **Storage and State Management** | Substrate and EVM manage storage and state differently, potentially causing inefficiencies or data loss. | Challenges in data management that could impact application performance and state consistency. |
| **Event Handling and Logging** | Different systems for events and logs can impact how dApps function and interact.                        | Ensuring consistent and accurate event logging and handling across both platforms is crucial. |
| **Tooling and Developer Experience** | Differences in development tools, languages, and environments between Substrate (Rust) and EVM (Solidity). | Learning curve and potential for bugs due to tool adaptation issues. |
| **Upgradeability and Governance** | Discrepancies in how Substrate and EVM handle upgrades and governance.                                  | Possible governance conflicts and upgrade incompatibilities. |
| **Inter-Contract Communication** | Communication between Substrate and EVM contracts may require special protocols or bridges.              | Adds complexity and potential failure points in contract interactions. |
