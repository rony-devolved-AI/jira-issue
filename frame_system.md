Sure, let's break down each of these parameter types and their significance for the `frame_system` configuration in your Substrate runtime.

### `BlockHashCount`

```rust
pub const BlockHashCount: BlockNumber = 2400;
```

- **Purpose:** This constant defines the number of recent block hashes that the runtime will store. Block hashes are often used for referencing past blocks and for providing proof-of-existence.
- **Example Use Case:** When a light client is syncing, it may reference block hashes to ensure it has the correct chain state.

### `Version`

```rust
pub const Version: RuntimeVersion = VERSION;
```

- **Purpose:** This constant sets the current version of the runtime. The `RuntimeVersion` contains metadata about the runtime, such as the spec version, transaction version, and implementation name.
- **Example Use Case:** When upgrading the runtime, the version helps nodes recognize that they need to update to a new runtime version.

### `RuntimeBlockLength`

```rust
pub RuntimeBlockLength: BlockLength = BlockLength::max_with_normal_ratio(5 * 1024 * 1024, NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO);
```

- **Purpose:** This parameter sets the maximum block size in bytes. The `BlockLength::max_with_normal_ratio` function sets both the maximum block size and the ratio for normal dispatches.
- **Example Use Case:** This ensures that blocks do not exceed a certain size, which helps maintain predictable performance and resource usage across the network.

### `RuntimeBlockWeights`

```rust
pub RuntimeBlockWeights: BlockWeights = BlockWeights::builder()
    .base_block(BlockExecutionWeight::get())
    .for_class(DispatchClass::all(), |weights| {
        weights.base_extrinsic = ExtrinsicBaseWeight::get();
    })
    .for_class(DispatchClass::Normal, |weights| {
        weights.max_total = Some(NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO * MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT);
    })
    .for_class(DispatchClass::Operational, |weights| {
        weights.max_total = Some(MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT);
        weights.reserved = Some(MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT - NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO * MAXIMUM_BLOCK_WEIGHT);
    })
    .avg_block_initialization(AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO)
    .build_or_panic();
```

- **Purpose:** This parameter configures the weights and limits for blocks. `BlockWeights` includes several configurations:
  - **`base_block`:** The base weight consumed by a block, obtained from `BlockExecutionWeight::get()`.
  - **`base_extrinsic`:** The base weight consumed by an extrinsic, obtained from `ExtrinsicBaseWeight::get()`.
  - **`max_total`:** The maximum weight for each class of dispatch (normal or operational).
  - **`reserved`:** The reserved weight for operational transactions.
  - **`avg_block_initialization`:** The average ratio of block initialization weight.
- **Example Use Case:** This ensures that blocks stay within the limits of computational resources and that critical (operational) transactions can be included even when normal transactions fill up most of the block.

### `MaxCollectivesProposalWeight`

```rust
pub MaxCollectivesProposalWeight: Weight = Perbill::from_percent(50) * RuntimeBlockWeights::get().max_block;
```

- **Purpose:** This constant sets the maximum weight that a proposal from collective governance (e.g., a council) can have.
- **Example Use Case:** This ensures that governance proposals do not consume more than a specified percentage (50% in this case) of the total block weight, leaving room for other transactions and operations.

### `const_assert!`

```rust
const_assert!(NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO.deconstruct() >= AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO.deconstruct());
```

- **Purpose:** This is a compile-time assertion that checks whether the `NORMAL_DISPATCH_RATIO` is greater than or equal to the `AVERAGE_ON_INITIALIZE_RATIO`.
- **Example Use Case:** Ensures that the normal dispatch ratio is sufficient to cover the average block initialization ratio, preventing misconfiguration that could lead to runtime errors.

### Summary

- **`BlockHashCount`:** Number of recent block hashes stored.
- **`Version`:** Current version of the runtime.
- **`RuntimeBlockLength`:** Maximum block size in bytes.
- **`RuntimeBlockWeights`:** Configuration for block weights and limits.
- **`MaxCollectivesProposalWeight`:** Maximum weight for collective governance proposals.
- **`const_assert!`:** Ensures valid configuration for dispatch ratios.

These parameters collectively help maintain the efficiency, stability, and predictability of the blockchain's performance.
